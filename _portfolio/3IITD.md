### About the Study:
Drug Discovery is an expensive and protracted process. Recent works aim to use in-silico methods, like generative models, to narrow chemical search space for drugs. It is in this field the so-called 'quantum-advantage' is expected. I survey Quantum ML methods for small-molecule generation in a literature review.
