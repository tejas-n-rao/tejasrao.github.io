### About the Study:
We are studying the biophysical factors that affect the susceptibility of Fast-Spiking Neurons to enter Depolarisation Block, a cell state present in Schizophrenia, Parkinon's and Epilepsy. Findings corroborate a plausible mechanism that contribute towards increased susceptibility and will be reported in a Manuscript.

Conducting further work under Prof. Shyam to extend the schema to a network of neurons.
