### About the Study:
Due to throughput and depth related advantages **Data Independent Acquisition** (DIA) Mass-Spectroscopy is growing in prevalence in bottom-up quantitative proteomics, especially with the advent of instrumentation like Astral. The ability of these methods to characterise the Glycoproteome is an understudied, and this project is aimed at filling this gap.
